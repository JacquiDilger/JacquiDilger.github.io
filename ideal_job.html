    <h1>Jacqui's Profile</h1>

    <h3>Ideal Job:</h3>
    <p>After looking on seek.com.au, I found a junior position as a front-end web developer at AdTorque Edge, Melbourne.
        You can find the advertisement <a
                href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53841843?type=standard#searchRequestToken=6b4507f4-334b-44df-8985-fa6445b784da,">here</a>,
        or you can access and download a .pdf version <a href="frontend_web_designer_job.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The job itself is a role primarily surrounded around designing a visibly pleasing website, with maximum
        functionality and readability. You’re also expected to work collaboratively with the client, and constantly
        refine and improve the efficiency of the website. I’ve always found web design to be a particularly interesting
        field within IT; I like the idea of making things aesthetically pleasing while simultaneously being
        straight-forward and accessible to all.</p>

    <span>The requirements for this role are extensive, but at a minimum the following technical experience is
            expected:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>An in-depth understanding of either WordPress or Joomla from a front-end perspective.</li>
        <li>A good grasp on how to use a combination of HTML, CSS and presumably JavaScript to create a responsive
            layout.
        </li>
        <li>Knowledge of Adobe Creative Cloud.</li>
        <li>A basic understanding of SEO (Search Engine Optimisation, which is the concept of having search engines
            like Google show your website at every opportunity possible).
        </li>
        <li>The ability to pay close attention to design details.</li>
        <li>A solid understanding of good User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) principals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>dont forget to add final sections</p>
