    <h3>Personal Information / Introduction:</h3>

    <p>My name is Jacqueline (Jacqui) Rose Dilger, and I’m a new student at RMIT. My student number is s3922650, and my
        student email is s3922650@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born and raised in Launceston, Tasmania by my beautiful
        mother Maxine, only a couple of minutes up the road from The Cataract Gorge. Here's a picture of myself and my
        wonky little friend, Crumpet!</p>

    <p>I’ve gained my Tasmanian Certificate of Education and a Certificate II in Hospitality through Launceston College,
        as well as a Certificate III in Print Communications at TasTAFE.</p>

    <p>My absolute favourite pastime is gaming. Any platform, any game, I’m always entertained. I have my own
        custom-built PC, and recently bought a PS5. I also have a collection of used consoles that I’ve been too
        attached to to throw out, including the likes of many PlayStation and DS variants, and a bunch of old games that
        are most likely too scratched up to run successfully anyways (I really should consider culling the bunch). I’m
        also a massive sucker for the Nintendo Switch!</p>
