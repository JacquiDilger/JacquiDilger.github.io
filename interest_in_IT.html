    <h3>Interest in IT:</h3>

    <h4>What is your Interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h4>
    <p>I’ve always been drawn to technology. When I was growing up, the family PC became my best friend. I could
        play the days away on some staple early 2000’s PC games like Pac-Man: Adventures in Time and SpongeBob
        Square Pants: Employee of the Month (and of course I can’t skip over the absolute classics like Minesweeper
        and Pinball). This fixation (borderline obsession) grew bigger and bigger, and I very quickly became the
        family IT troubleshooter. I have vivid memories of myself and my older sister walking about 5 kilometres to
        our local Kmart to buy the newest Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock when we were about 7 and 14 respectively,
        and we didn't put it down for months. I even still have the guitars and use them to occasionally play the PC
        emulator version, Clone Hero.</p>

    <h4>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your Interest in IT?</h4>
    <p>My sister and Dad are definitely to thank for my interest in gaming, but primary school is where I began to love
        using PCs for convenience in everyday life. Between using them for word processing, research, educational games
        and email conversations, I managed to build a lot of essential knowledge that I still use in a daily
        context.</p>

    <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
    <p>I chose RMIT primarily because of the great reputation it has, especially in the IT Field. Because I live in
        Tasmania there aren't many options locally, so I made the decision to commit to online study. Thanks to Open
        Universities, I was informed of the RMIT Online Bachelor of IT, and I signed up straight away. Because I have
        had previous experience studying online with TasTAFE, I feel very prepared and even excited to put in the hard
        work.</p>

    <h4>What do you expect to learn from your studies?</h4>
    <p>By completing my Bachelor of IT, I aim to have built a solid understanding on a range of areas within the IT
        industry, enough so that whichever path I choose, I’m able to adapt and expand my knowledge.</p>
