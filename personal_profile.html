    <h3>Personal Profile / Personality Test Results:</h3>
    <p>The results of these tests were eerily accurate for the most part; especially the Myers-Briggs test. Being
        labelled the Mediator really resonated with me, especially with being introverted. I’ve always been a shy
        person, so this result was definitely expected. The Myers-Briggs profile also goes deeply into how I am a
        massive empath, and how that helps me build connections, and how we can use our insights and perspectives to
        help us understand others, and how they may be in need of some help. </p>
    <p>I think that being a Mediator will help team scenarios as I won’t have this ironclad way that things must be
        done, but more so want people to work together the best that they can, because forcing people into a set way to
        do things can backfire if it’s not the way that they do their best work. Keeping all of these results in mind,
        the best way to tackle group work is going to be pushing myself outside of
        my boundaries and trying my best to be more social. </p>
